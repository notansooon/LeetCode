# Given a string s, you can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string.

# Return a list of all possible strings we could create. Return the output in any order.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: s = "a1b2"
# Output: ["a1b2","a1B2","A1b2","A1B2"]
# Example 2:

# Input: s = "3z4"
# Output: ["3z4","3Z4"]

# Input: s = s = "a1b2c"
# Output: [
#     "a1b2c",
#     "a1B2c",
#     "A1b2c",
#     "A1B2c",
#     "a1b2C",
#     "a1B2C",
#     "A1b2C",
#     "A1B2C"
